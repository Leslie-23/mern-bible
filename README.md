## 📖 **How It Works**
The MERN Bible allows **anyone** to look up and read Bible chapters.  
For logged-in users, there's an additional feature to **save verses** to a personal list.

### Features:
- **Look up Bible chapters** — Available for everyone.
- **Save verses** — Logged-in users can save and manage their favorite verses.
- **Verse management** — Save a verse by clicking on it, and add it to your list by selecting `"+ [verse number]"`.
  - **Remove a verse** from your saved list by clicking the verse and selecting `"-"`.

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

Enhancements for the future include:
- **Notes**: Attach personal notes to saved verses.
- **Custom Messages**: Add sophisticated error/confirmation messages.
- **Advanced Navigation**: Improve Bible navigation and offer modern Bible translations.
  - *Note*: Switching Bible APIs may be necessary due to BibleSuperSearch's 1,000/day request limit and lack of support for some modern translations.
